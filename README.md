# 24-Hour Clock FPGA Design
## Overview
This project implements a 24-hour digital clock on an FPGA using VHDL. The clock displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) on a 7-segment display and outputs the current seconds on LEDs. The design includes features for resetting the clock and adjusting the clock frequency.
